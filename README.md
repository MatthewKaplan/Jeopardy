# Overview
Our Revenge of the Nerds Game is loosely based on the popular TV game show Jeopardy. Three users will interact with a board of questions where each person has a turn and will hold that turn until they incorrectly answer a question. There are 2 rounds, and a round is complete once all of the questions have been selected. At the end of two rounds a final round will allow each user to wager up to the amount of points they have collected throughout the game. The player with the most points at the end of the final round will be the winner.
