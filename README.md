# Jeopardy
## By Matt and Tim Miller
This was a paired project in which we needed to write a program in OOP style in the theme of Revenge of the Nerds.

## Project Description
Our Revenge of the Nerds Game is loosely based on the popular TV game show Jeopardy. Three users will interact with a board of questions where each person has a turn and will hold that turn until they incorrectly answer a question. There are 2 rounds, and a round is complete once all of the questions have been selected. At the end of two rounds a final round will allow each user to wager up to the amount of points they have collected throughout the game. The player with the most points at the end of the final round will be the winner.

# What We gained from this project
In making this app we have gained a better understanding of the pros and cons of OOP vs functional programming. It has also given us an opportunity to practice writing our own tests with Mocha and Chai.

# Dependecies
Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:
###npm install
To verify that it is setup correctly, run npm start in your terminal. Go to http://localhost:8080/ and you should see a page with some h1 text and a pink background. If that's the case, enter control + c in your terminal to stop the server.

## How to View Your Code in Action
In the terminal, run:
###npm start
You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
Go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to view your code running in the browser.
